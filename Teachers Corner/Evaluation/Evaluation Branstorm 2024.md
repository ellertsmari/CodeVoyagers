# Evaluation Brainstorm - SusIsland 2024

## Accommodation:
- danish and icelandic students should stay in the same hotel to increase stronger relations
- important with a common area for meetups and workspace

## Icebreaker activity
- better planning to make sure that groups dont go together at the same destinations
- how do we solve transportation challenges  

## Workflow
- map/list of technologies
- guides to hosting
- groups should create hosting and repository at the projekt start. Thereby they can put up QR codes for the project
- consider the representation of one spanish student in each group

## Weekend activity
- good idea to move the weekend activity to friday as it releases the weekend and eases the participation of spanish students
-  the San Jos√© del Alamo barbecue is a good idea but we need to some changes to increase a good experience for everyone
    - a more structured planning of the barbecure so everybody knows what is going to happen and how
    - maybe every group should have a certain task in the barbecure - like doing the grill, shopping, making of salad, drinks, cleaning etc. So everyone has a piece of responsibility. This will also help avoiding to much time away form the project for some students.
    - better information on how a barbecue works in Spain so everbody knows how to get food
    - better and more clear information on how many is going by bus.

## Presentations
- a more simple schedule for the presentations to avoid information overload 
    - links to repository and design sprint so teachers can evaluate these parts afterwords
    - overall presentation of the concept, workflow, design, victories, defeats and learning achievements
- pizza break should be in between the presentations
- groups should put up a QR code for their application so that other groups can scan and evaluate the UI/UX
